## 📦 Database Concepts & Capabilities

### Core Concepts

FiberDB uses two primary data structures:

1. **Anchors**: Core entities that serve as primary data points (e.g., customers, assets, business partners)
2. **Attachments**: Related data connected to anchors (e.g., service requests, meter readings, addresses)

This design enables a flexible, document-based architecture while maintaining relational capabilities.

### Anchor-Based Storage Model

The anchor-based model allows:

- **Vertical Data Partitioning**: Separate core entities from related data
- **Flexible Schema**: Add new attached documents without changing the anchor structure
- **Entity Relationships**: Connect and query across entities
- **Selective Loading**: Only load required data attachments during queries

### Data Operations

#### Creating Anchors

```ts
// Create a new business partner
saveAnchor("business-partner", "BP12345678", {
  id: "BP12345678",
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  customerClassification: "A",
  birthDate: "1985-05-15"
}, { 
  secureFields: ["firstName", "lastName", "birthDate"], 
  key: "encryption-key" 
});
```

#### Attaching Related Data

```ts
// Attach address information to a business partner
attachToAnchor("BP12345678", "addresses", [
  {
    street: "123 Main St",
    city: "Springfield",
    postalCode: "12345",
    addressType: "BILL"
  }
]);

// Attach contract information
attachToAnchor("BP12345678", "contracts", [
  {
    contractId: "CT12345",
    utilityType: "ELEC",
    startDate: "2023-01-01",
    status: "ACTIVE"
  }
]);
```

### Query System

FiberDB provides a powerful query system with multiple capabilities:

#### Basic ID Queries

```ts
// Query a specific business partner by ID
const result = await query({
  primary: "business-partner",
  id: "BP12345678"
});
```

#### Field Selection

```ts
// Query with specific field selection
const result = await query({
  primary: "business-partner",
  id: "BP12345678",
  include: ["firstName", "lastName", "addresses", "contracts"]
});
```

#### Filtering

```ts
// Filter business partners by classification
const result = await query({
  primary: "business-partner",
  filter: { customerClassification: "A" },
  include: ["firstName", "lastName"]
});
```

#### Advanced Filtering with Operators

```ts
// Find business partners with active contracts
const result = await query({
  primary: "business-partner",
  include: ["firstName", "lastName", "contracts"],
  where: {
    "contracts.status": { eq: "ACTIVE" }
  }
});

// Find business partners with high-priority service requests
const result = await query({
  primary: "business-partner",
  include: ["firstName", "lastName", "service-requests"],
  where: {
    "service-requests.priority": { gt: 3 }
  }
});

// Text search capabilities
const result = await query({
  primary: "business-partner",
  include: ["firstName", "lastName", "addresses"],
  where: {
    "addresses.city": { contains: "Springfield" }
  }
});

// Array membership check
const result = await query({
  primary: "business-partner",
  filter: {
    region: { in: ["WEST", "SOUTH"] }
  }
});

// Inequality check
const result = await query({
  primary: "business-partner",
  filter: {
    customerClassification: { ne: "D" }
  }
});
```

#### Combined Filters

```ts
// Complex query combining anchor and attachment filters
const result = await query({
  primary: "business-partner",
  filter: { 
    customerClassification: "A",
    region: "WEST" 
  },
  include: ["firstName", "lastName", "contracts", "meters"],
  where: {
    "contracts.status": { eq: "ACTIVE" },
    "contracts.utilityType": { eq: "ELEC" },
    "meters.isSmartMeter": { eq: true }
  }
});
```

### Security & Encryption

FiberDB provides field-level encryption:

```ts
// Encrypt sensitive fields during storage
saveAnchor("business-partner", "BP12345678", {
  id: "BP12345678",
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  socialSecurityNumber: "123-45-6789"
}, { 
  secureFields: ["firstName", "lastName", "socialSecurityNumber"], 
  key: "encryption-key" 
});

// Query with decryption key to access secure fields
const result = await query({
  primary: "business-partner",
  id: "BP12345678",
  include: ["firstName", "lastName", "socialSecurityNumber"],
  decryptionKey: "encryption-key"
});
```

Without the decryption key, encrypted fields remain encrypted in query results.

### Performance Optimization

#### Caching System

FiberDB uses a multi-level caching system:

```ts
// Use caching for better performance (enabled by default)
const result = await query({
  primary: "business-partner",
  id: "BP12345678"
});

// Force fresh data by skipping cache
const freshResult = await query({
  primary: "business-partner",
  id: "BP12345678",
  skipCache: true
});
```

#### Parallel Processing

```ts
// Enable parallel processing for large datasets
const result = await query({
  primary: "business-partner",
  include: ["firstName", "lastName", "contracts"],
  useParallel: true
});
```

#### Indexing

```ts
// Use index-based queries (enabled by default)
const result = await query({
  primary: "business-partner",
  filter: { region: "WEST" },
  useIndexes: true
});
```

### Performance Measurement

```ts
// Enable performance metrics in your query
const result = await query({
  primary: "business-partner",
  filter: { customerClassification: "A" },
  includePerformanceMetrics: true
});

// Access metrics in the result
console.log(result[0].__metrics);
```

### Query Examples

FiberDB includes comprehensive query examples demonstrating all available query types and performance optimizations:

```bash
# First, seed the database with test data
bun run seed:sap

# Then run the query examples
bun run examples
```

> **Important**: The examples require data to be seeded first, otherwise all queries will return empty results.

The examples are located in `src/examples/query-examples.ts` and cover:

1. **Basic Queries**
   - Single entity by ID
   - All entities of a type
   - Field selection
   - Wildcard field inclusion
   - Specific attachment selection

2. **Filtering**
   - Simple equality filters
   - Multiple conditions (AND logic)
   - Filtering on attached documents
   - Combined primary and attachment filters

3. **Advanced Filtering Operators**
   - Equality (`eq`)
   - Not Equal (`ne`)
   - Greater Than (`gt`)
   - Less Than (`lt`)
   - Contains (text search)
   - In (value in array)
   - Combined operators

4. **Security & Encryption**
   - Queries with encrypted fields
   - Queries with decryption key

5. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Caching system usage
   - Parallel processing
   - Index-based queries
   - Performance metrics

6. **API Integration**
   - HTTP API request examples
   - Header-based performance controls

You can use these examples as templates for your own queries, adapting them to your specific use cases.

### Testing

FiberDB includes a comprehensive testing suite to ensure reliability and correctness:

```bash
# Run all tests
bun run test
```

#### Test Architecture

Our testing approach consists of three main strategies:

1. **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components in isolation
   - Core query methods
   - Cache utilities
   - API endpoints
   
2. **Integration Tests**: Testing interactions between components
   - API router with endpoint handlers
   - Query systems with storage layer
   
3. **Mock-based Testing**: Using mock dependencies for reliable tests
   - File system mocks to avoid actual I/O operations
   - Service mocks to simulate external dependencies
   - Response mocks to verify correct output formats

#### Test Organization

```
src/tests/
├── api/                 # API-related tests
│   ├── endpoints.test.ts # Tests for API endpoint handlers
│   └── router.test.ts    # Tests for API routing
├── core/                # Core functionality tests
│   └── query-methods.test.ts # Tests for query engine
└── utils/               # Utility tests
    └── cache.test.ts    # Tests for caching system
```

#### Writing Tests

When contributing new features, please follow these testing guidelines:

1. Create tests in the appropriate directory based on the component being tested
2. Use mocks to avoid external dependencies and filesystem operations
3. Test both success and error cases
4. Keep tests isolated and independent from one another
5. Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior

### HTTP API Usage

```bash
# Query via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Include-Performance-Metrics: true" \
  -d '{
    "primary": "business-partner",
    "filter": { "customerClassification": "A" },
    "include": ["firstName", "lastName", "contracts"],
    "where": {
      "contracts.status": { "eq": "ACTIVE" }
    },
    "decryptionKey": "encryption-key"
  }'
```

API Control Headers:
- `X-Skip-Cache: true` - Force a fresh query without using cache

bun run seed:sap

# Generate 200 business partners with related data
bun run seed:sap-large
```

### Available Seeders

- **Business Partners**: Generates realistic business partners with SAP-style fields
- **Addresses**: Creates multiple address types (billing, installation)
- **Contracts**: Generates utility contracts with appropriate relationships
- **Meters**: Creates meter installations linked to active contracts
- **Bank Accounts**: Generates bank account information with secure fields
- **Contact Information**: Creates email, phone, and mobile contact details

### Custom Seeding

```bash
# Custom seeding with specific options
bun run src/seeders/run-seeder.ts --sap-only --sap-bp-count 100 --clear
```

Options:
- `--clear`: Clear existing data before seeding
- `--sap-only`: Only generate SAP Utilities data
- `--sap-bp-count <number>`: Number of business partners to generate

## 📊 Performance Optimization

FiberDB includes advanced performance optimizations:

### Query Performance Control

All performance optimizations can be controlled through query parameters:

```ts
// Enable all performance optimizations
const result = await query({
  primary: "business-partner",
  filter: { customerClassification: "A" },
  
  // Performance control parameters
  skipCache: false,        // Use cache when available
  useParallel: true,       // Enable parallel processing
  useIndexes: true,        // Use indexes for filtering
  includePerformanceMetrics: true  // Include timing metrics
});
```

When using the HTTP API, these controls can be set through request headers:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Skip-Cache: false" \
  -H "X-Use-Parallel: true" \
  -H "X-Include-Performance-Metrics: true" \
  -d '{ "primary": "business-partner" }'
```

For comprehensive examples of all performance optimizations, see the [Query Examples](#query-examples) section.

### Caching System

- **Document Caching**: LRU cache for frequently accessed JSON documents
- **Query Result Caching**: Cache query results to avoid repeated processing
- **File Existence Caching**: Avoid repeated filesystem checks
- **TTL-based Caching**: Automatic expiration of cached data
- **Cache Invalidation**: Smart invalidation on writes

### Parallel Processing

- **Asynchronous File I/O**: Non-blocking file operations with Bun's optimized I/O
- **Concurrent Processing**: Process multiple files simultaneously
- **Promise.all**: Parallel execution of file operations
- **Performance Scaling**: Up to 5x faster for large datasets

Performance improvements with parallel processing:
- Small datasets (1-5 files): Traditional synchronous processing is faster
- Medium datasets (50-200 files): 24-60% faster with parallel processing
- Large datasets (600+ files): 74-81% faster with parallel processing

### Indexing

- **Hash Indexes**: Fast equality lookups for specific fields
- **Range Indexes**: Efficient gt/lt comparisons
- **Text Indexes**: Optimized text search capabilities
- **Automatic Index Selection**: Uses the most appropriate index for each query
- **Index Statistics**: Tracks index usage and performance

### API Control Headers

When using the HTTP API, you can control performance features:

- `X-Skip-Cache: true` - Force a fresh query without using cache
- `X-Use-Parallel: true` - Enable parallel processing for the query
- `X-Include-Performance-Metrics: true` - Include detailed timing information

### Monitoring

Access cache statistics via the `/cache` endpoint:
- `GET /cache` - View cache statistics
- `DELETE /cache` - Clear all caches
